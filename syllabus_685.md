# Learning Outcomes

From this course, you should achieve the following learning outcomes:

* Explain how Data Science differs from the traditional disciplines of Statistics and Computer Science
* Distinguish different data types and understand how to process them
* Understand the operations, syntax, and good practices for programming in R and apply them to solve data science problems
* Maintain documentation, versions, and revisions of their code using Markdown, Git, and GitHub
* Organize data in a "tidy" way for storage and analysis
* Manipulate and clean data to prepare it for automated analysis
* Create visualizations to accurately and effectively communicate data-driven insights
* Disseminate your work using multiple modes such as reports, tutorials, blog posts, websites, dashboards
* Building your data science profile
* Apply algorithms and statistics appropriately for exploratory data analysis
* Basic text processing, including sentiment analysis and regular expressions

# Required Materials

A laptop is required in each class meeting. Mac OSX and Windows 10 laptops are preferred. 
If you have a different system, consult with the professor, but understand that lessons
and support may be different for your computer and you are responsible for meeting the requirements
